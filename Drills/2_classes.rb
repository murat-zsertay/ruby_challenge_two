# In this set of exercises you'll build small classes
# Some will have no methods
# Some will have one or two simple methods
# Some will have one or two more complex methods
# Some classes are instantiated with args

# Each exercise will have the same format for the requirements
# The first line tells you what the class name should be
# If the class is instantiated with args, these come next
# The rest tells you what methods should be implemented

# Example requirements

# Greeter
# instantiated with a name. E.g. 'Bobby'
# hello
# returns 'hello, Bobby'
# goodbye
# returns 'goodbye, Bobby'

# Example solution

class Greeter
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def hello
    return 'hello, ' + @name
  end

  def goodbye
    return 'goodbye, ' + @name
  end
end

# Animal
# no methods required
class Animal

end
# Vehicle
# no methods required
class Vehicle

end
# Cat
# speak
# returns 'miaow'
class Cat
  def speak
    'miaow'
  end
end
# Dog
# speak
# returns 'woof'
class Dog
  def speak
    'woof'
  end
end

# block_caps

# method add
